Create an application in either React or Angular. The application will manipulate a contact list. Persistence to a back end is not required.
 
The application will be evaluated on:
1. Usage of state
2. Routing
3. Forms
4. Overall architecture
5. Styling
6. Accessibility
 
Requirements for the application are as follows.
1. You may use a set of existing contacts for the list. Hard code a list to start with. The list may reside in memory and be manipulated by the add, edit, and delete functions.
2. Contact information should consist of:
a. First name
b. Last name
c. Phone number
d. Email address
 
3. Initially the user should be viewing a page with a list of existing contacts. In the contacts list, a contact should be shown with a card style layout. Each card should consist of:
a. First name
b. Last name
c. Phone number
 
4. From the Contact Listing page, the user should be able to:
a. Edit an existing contact
i. All fields are editable
ii. Create a separate page for editing
b. View a contact
i. Expand a contact to view all information
c. Delete an existing user
i. A simple delete with a confirmation popup. Are you sure you want to delete “Contact”?
d. Create a new contact

After any contact actions have been performed, the list must update to reflect any changes
